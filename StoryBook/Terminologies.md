# Terminologies

## General Terminologies

| Term | Description | Example |
| - | - | - |
| AI/ Artificial Intelligence | Its the intelligence that humans try to impart artificially in machines. |  |
| ML/ Machine Learning | Its basically creating a mathematical/ statistical formula (often complicated) and adjusting its parameters to predict the result.  | |
| ML Model | Its the mathematical/ statistical formula that will predict the results. | Linear regression, CNN, RNN, etc |
| Training data | Data used to adjust the model's parameters to make the results better |  |
| Validation/ Test data | Data used to verify how good the model/ formula is. |  |
| Noisy Data | Data containing disturbance/ errors/ noise/ faults is called noisy data. | Grammatical/ spelling mistakes in data, Distorted Audio, Blur Image, etc |
| Model Parameters | These are simple numbers that are used in the formula along with the data input to calculate the output/ result |  |
| Model Training/ Fitting | The process of using the training dataset to adjust the mathematical formula parameters is called training/ fitting. |  |
| Testing/ Evaluation | Its the process of using the test data to check the accuracy of the model outputs/ formula results. |  |
| Supervised Learning | The model training in which the data has labels/ pre-defined outputs, is called supervised learning. |  |
| Un-supervised Learning | The model training in which the data doesn't has labels/ pre-defined outputs, is called un-supervised learning. Here, the model has to identify the pattern itself. |  |
| Semi-supervised Learning | The model training in which the data has partial labels/ pre-defined outputs, is called semi-supervised learning. |  |
| Loss/ Cost Functions | It is a mathematical function/ formula that quantifies the error or discrepancy between the predicted values generated by a model and the true (actual) values in a supervised learning. | RMSE, RSE, etc |
| Optimizer | Optimizers are functions that adjust the model's parameters (e.g., weights and biases) during the training process to minimize the loss function and improve the model's performance. | SGD, Adam, etc |
| Evaluation Metrics | These are measurements used to assess the performance and quality of model. | Accuracy, MSE, R-squared, etc |
| LR/ Learning Rate/ Step Size | The rate at which we want to change the parameters of the model. More the LR, faster and more significantly the parameters change and vice versa. |  |

## Object Terminologies

| Term | Description | Example |
| - | - | - |
| Vector | A physical/ mathematical object having direction and magnitude. ex: `3i + 4j + 5k`. It can be represented by a row or column | `[3, 4, 5]` |
| Vector Space | Collection of all vectors that follow the rules of vector addition and scalar multiplication | `[1, 2, 3]`,<br> `[4, 5, 6]`,<br> `[0, 0, 2]`,<br> ... |
| Matrix | It is a n-dimensional object representing data | `[[1, 2, 3]`,<br> `[4, 5, 6]`,<br> `[0, 0, 2]]`, <br> ... |
