# Story of AI/ ML

## What is AI/ ML?

- **AI/ Artificial Intelligence**: Its the intelligence that humans try to impart artificially in machines.
    - AI is just a theory/ concept.

- **ML/ Machine Learning**: Its basically creating a mathematical/ statistical formula (often complicated) and adjusting its parameters to predict the result.
    - ML is the practical approach to AI


## Why AI/ ML ?

- To make things faster, smarter, more reliable and accurate.
- To automate tasks

## How is AI/ ML different than any other algorithm?

- The algorithm is used to fit a formula into a data by changing formula's parameters
- Normal algorithms have pre-defined or very limited flexibility in the steps and formulas written
- AI can adapt to noisy/ erroneous data
- Automatic decision making

## How can we do AI/ ML?

AI is achieved through ML. ML can be done by training a model and using it to solve tasks.
- Model is simply a maths formula

### Steps to build own ML model

1. collect data
    - collection includes downloading and merging data from all sources
    - generation of artificial data 

2. clean data
    - removing all errors/ inconsistencies
    - fixing blank values

3. prepare data
    - splitting data into train and test datasets

4. train model

5. evaluate model using test data

6. deploy model for real use
