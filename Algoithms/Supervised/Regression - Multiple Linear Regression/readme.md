# Multiple Linear Regression

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression

In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach for modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables (also known as dependent and independent variables). The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression; for more than one, the process is called multiple linear regression. This term is distinct from multivariate linear regression, where multiple correlated dependent variables are predicted, rather than a single scalar variable.

Formula:

> `yi = m1 * xi1 + m2 * xi2 + m3 * xi3 + ... + mp * xip + c + e`

- yi = dependent variable
- xip = independent variable
- mp = slope for each independent variable
- c = intercept
- e = model's error term
- p = 1 to n
- n = number of independent variables
