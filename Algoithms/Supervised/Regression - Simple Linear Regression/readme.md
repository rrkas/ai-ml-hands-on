# Simple Linear Regression

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_linear_regression

Simple linear regression is used to model the relationship between two continuous variables. Often, the objective is to predict the value of an output variable (or response) based on the value of an input (or predictor) variable.

Formula:

> `y = mx + c`

- m = slope
- c = intercept
