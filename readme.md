## Libraries
| Library | Description |
| - | - |
| NumPy | Maths library, much faster & robust |
| Pandas | Table library, action packed |
| Matplotlib | graphs and plots |
| Seaborn | beautiful graphs and plots |

## Steps
1. Data Sourcing/ Collection/ Generation

2. Exploratory Data Analysis
    - Knowing the data
    - Uni-variate Analysis
    - Bi-variate Analysis
    - Multi-variate Analysis
    - Derived Matrix

3. Data Cleaning
    - fix rows & columns
    - fix missing values
        - fill with some constant value
        - fill with mean/ median value
        - remove that row/ record
    - fix invalid values
        - validations
    - fix alignment issues
    - standardize values
        - scaling
        - outlier detection
    - filter data
        - remove duplicates/ redundancies
    - etc

4. Data Preparation
    - Converting data into training format
    - Splitting data into train and test datasets

5. Training

6. Testing & Evaluation

7. Deploy


## Algorithms
1. Supervised
    - Regression
        - [Simple Linear Regression](./Algoithms/Supervised/Regression%20-%20Simple%20Linear%20Regression/readme.md)
    - Classification

2. Un-Supervised
    - Clustering

3. Semi-Supervised
