# One-Hot Encoder

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-hot

- In digital circuits and machine learning, a one-hot is a group of bits among which the legal combinations of values are only those with a single high (1) bit and all the others low (0).

-  A similar implementation in which all bits are '1' except one '0' is sometimes called one-cold.

-  In statistics, dummy variables represent a similar technique for representing categorical data.
