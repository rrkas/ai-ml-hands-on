# Cosine similarity

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity

- In data analysis, cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors defined in an inner product space. 

- Cosine similarity is the cosine of the angle between the vectors; that is, it is the dot product of the vectors divided by the product of their lengths. 

- It follows that the cosine similarity does not depend on the magnitudes of the vectors, but only on their angle. 

- The cosine similarity always belongs to the interval [-1,1]. 

- In some contexts, the component values of the vectors cannot be negative, in which case the cosine similarity is bounded in [0,1].

- For example, two proportional vectors have a cosine similarity of 1, two orthogonal vectors have a similarity of 0, and two opposite vectors have a similarity of -1.
