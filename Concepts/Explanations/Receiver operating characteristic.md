# Receiver operating characteristic (ROC)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic


A receiver operating characteristic curve, or ROC curve, is a graphical plot that illustrates the performance of a binary classifier model at varying threshold values.

The ROC curve is the plot of the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at each threshold setting.
